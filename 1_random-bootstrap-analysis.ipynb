    "In this notebook, it shows how to do the randomization of the sample, power effect simulation, and the analysis itself after we collect the data of the experiment. We can reproduce this notebook for other calculations, not only logistic regression that is shown in this notebook. With a little bit modification, we can use the other models from the regression.\n",

    "Using the Bootstrap-CI 90% and the bootstrap size of 100 times, we know that the one-click treatment significantly increases the booking rate of the hotel. When we're trying to interpret the coefficient, there's a big different between value between the predicted value and odds ratio method. As a safe railguard, we're going to use the odds ratio method. Thus, th**e one-click treatment significantly increases the booking rate by 17%.**\n",
